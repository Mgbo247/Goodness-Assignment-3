Question: How does expert system resolve rule base conflict resolution.

Answer: 


Expert systems use different methods for rule base conflict resolution. Here are the most common ones:

1. Priority scheme: Each rule is assigned a priority value, and the system follows the rules in the order of their priority.

2. Certainty factor scheme: Each rule is assigned a certainty factor that represents the degree of confidence in its conclusion. The system selects the rule with the highest certainty factor.

3. Weighted scheme: Each rule is assigned a weight value that represents its relative importance. The system selects the one with the highest weight.

4. Precedence scheme: This is similar to the priority scheme, but it takes into account the context of the situation in which the rules are applied to determine their order.

5. Time-stamp scheme: This method considers when a rule was added or modified in the rule base and applies the most recent rule.

Expert systems may use a combination of these methods to determine the appropriate rule to apply in a given context.
